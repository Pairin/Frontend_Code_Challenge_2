# Challenge

Build a clone of the [Google Trends visualizer](https://trends.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize?pn=p1&nrow=5&ncol=5) using pure React that displays random animal names.

## Requirements
 - A 5x5 grid of tiles showing current Trends
 - Each tile should type and animate like the [Google Trends visualizer](https://trends.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize?pn=p1&nrow=5&ncol=5)
 - Each time a tile is generated it should be a random color from a fixed set of colors (You can use the same colors as google trends if you want)
 - Use only React. No other runtime libraries. (Webpack and other build tools are fine)

## Bonus Requirements
Bonus requirements are all completely optional but will show us extra initiative and your skills.

 - Completely Random Colors with no adjacent tiles being the same color ([See Example](./no_adjacent.png))
 - Option to set grid size
   - *Example*: Add the option to make it anywhere from 1x1 to 20x20
 - Change Grid size automatically on window resize (Responsiveness)
 - Use CSS Grid

## Evaluation Criteria
 - Logic
  - We are interested in how well you handle logic such as randomization and filtering of data
 - CSS
   - How well and advanced your css techniques are.
   - Bonus points for using CSS Grid
 - React
  - How well your react fundamentals are and how well you separate functionality into components.

Timeliness is also a huge factor. While there is no maximum time, we are evaluating candidates on a rolling basis so if you take too long, we may accept another candidate before we can evaluate you.

# Submission
